libraries/opensk/ctap/data_formats.rs line 286 struct MakeCredentialExtensions I'm adding a line for recovery. This will probably break the entire system.
Added recovery as a struct field on line 327 of the same file.
Added recovery: false in the test on line 1691 of the same file.
Added let recovery = false on line 321 of the same file.

Interestingly, it compiled just fine after that and doesn't seem to have broken the entire system, so that's nifty.

Added let _recovery = extensions.recovery to line 870 of libraries/opensk/ctap/mod.rs
It still compiles!

Added a new enum on line 284 of data_formats.rs in ctap called RecoveryExtensionAction and a new struct on line 292 called RecoveryExtensionInputs. The allow_list field in that corresponds to the allowCredentials field in the Yubico instructions, but Rust wants it to be camel case, and google is using allow_list in other parts of the code for a similar thing, I think.

Added recovery.rs to ctap and added pub mod recovery at line 29 of mod.rs in ctap.

Added RecoveryExtensionOutput struct on line 299 of data_formats. The lengths of the arrays in there is currently just a guess, so we'll need to fix that eventually.

Note: I think that the insert function persistent_store/src/store.rs will take any byte array, and I think that I can use the CBOR functions to encode just about anything as a binary string, so I just need to find an available address (I think I read that they don't use anything past 2048) and just store stuff there as CBOR encodings. Hopefully it won't be too difficult.

So I think that env is storing all the information about the key. It has a store() function, which I think accesses the storage for the key, and store() has a find() and insert() function that get the value at a key or write a value to a key. I think that we can store values at 1000, because they say that it's reserved for future credential related objects, which I think is what our backup information would be.

If debugging is turned on, I think that debug_ctap!(env, string) will print string to console, which could be useful.

I think that opensk/src/ctap/storage.rs, line 48, has the function that creates the initial storage. I think we could just add a line to that function that initializes a YK struct and writes it to storage in the correct spot. From there we can do all the other edits to storage that we might want to do.

Added BackupData struct to data_formats.rs on line 309. It has fields for public and private keys and for a state. I'll add the list of recovery seeds later, after I figure out how to format them.

Commented out flags on lines 19 and 61 of crypto/src/ec/point.rs and lines 95 and 100 of crypto/src/ecdh.rs, as well as making from_bytes_compressed and to_bytes_compressed in ecdh.rs public functions.

Added a public function to_bytes to the struct SecKey on line 93 of crypto/src/ecdh.rs

Implemented init() for BackupData on line 315 of data_formats.rs.

Note: I keep doing stuff with mutable references to env, which I think means I'm editing the actual environment of the key, which is probably pretty dangerous. I don't think it's a huge deal since we don't care a ton about security right now, but it's something to remember.

Added use statement for BackupData on line 37 of ctap/storage.rs and use statement for cbor_backups from recovery.rs on line 38. Added use key::_RESERVED_CREDENTIALS on line 32.

Made edits on init function on line 52 of ctap/storage.rs so that now it initializes and stores a BackupData struct that will have all the recovery information.

Added get_backup_data function on line 71 of ctap/storage.rs.

Changed USB_DEBUGGING to false in boards/nordic/nrf52840dk_opensk/src/main.rs so that it will print debug to uart.

Added make_backup_data function on line 63 of ctap/storage.rs.

On line 33 of mod.rs I made storage a public module so that I can print stuff in the main loop. Felt cute, might change it later.

*IMPORTANT*
Added something on line 155 of main.rs which WE SHOULD REMOVE because it's just there to print some data, and it also RESETS THE BACKUP STORAGE every time through the loop, so it's not very good to have permanently.

Also added on line 156 to recover and print the backup key to see if it's the same as the one we originally created. Delete 155 and 156 at some point, because they sort of mess up the system.

Added use AAGUID_LENGTH to data_formats.rs

Added use crypto::ecdh::PubKey to line 26 of data formats.rs

Temporarily commented out the only_with_debug flag thing on lines 26 and 33 of main.rs. I'm going to commit and push that change to see if it will print without the debug flags.
